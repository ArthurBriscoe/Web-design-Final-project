		<h1>Tuesday - Deadlifts</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="main">
		<div class="workout">
			<h2>Warm Up</h2>

		</div>
		<div class="workout">

					<img id="Deadlifts" src="Barbell-Deadlift-1.webp">
					</div>
				- Sets: 5
				<br>- Reps: 5
				<br>- Tempo: 3-0-1
				<br>- Rest: 2-3 minutes
				<br>
				<br>- Stand with your feet hip-width apart and your chest up.
				<br>- Hold the barbell with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
				<br>- Lower your body as far as you can by pushing your hips back and bending your knees.
				<br>- Pause, then slowly push yourself back to the starting position.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="workout">
			<h2>Exercise 2: RDL's</h2>
			<p>

				<div id="RDL's">
					<img id="RDL's" src="Barbell-Romanian-Deadlift.webp">
					</div>
				- Sets: 2
				<br>- Since we did heavy RDL's the previous day, this day will be substantially lighter on this.
				<br>- Reps: 8
				<br>- Tempo: 3-0-1
				<br>- Rest: 2 minutes
				<br>- Hold either 2 dumbbells or a barbell about shoulder width apart.
				<br>- Slowly lower the weight down below the knees and then explode up.
				<br>- Don't go to low in order to keep this hamstring oriented
				<br>- 
				<br>- Pause, then slowly push yourself back to the starting position.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="workout">
			<h2>Exercise 3: Lat pull downs</h2>
			<p>
				- Sets: 4
				<br>- Reps: 12
				<br>- Tempo: 3-0-1
				<br>- Rest: 1-2 minutes
				<br>- First pick a good amount of weight that you can do without breaking form.
				<br>- Find your most comfortable grip width (Close, middle or wide).
				<br>- Before pulling, retract your scapula and brace your core.
				<br>- Pull the bar to your chest and slowly release.
				<br>- This is one of the best upper back builders.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="workout">
			<h2>Exercise 4: Bicep curls</h2>
			<p>

				<div id="Bicep curl">
					<img id="Bicep curl" src="Incline-dumbbell-inner-biceps-curl.webp">
					</div>
				- Sets: 5
				<br>- Reps: 8
				<br>- Tempo: 3-0-1
				<br>- Rest: 1-2 minutes
				<br>- Pick a good weight.
				<br>- Stand with dumbbells preferably infront of a mirror so you can check your form.
				<br>- Retract your arm and twist your wrist so at the top of the movement your pinkies are
				faced up.
				<br>- Minimize swinging in order to isolate the muscle.
				<br>- The only joint active should be your elbow.
