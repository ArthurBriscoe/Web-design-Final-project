					</div>
				- Sets: 4
				<br>- Reps: 8
				<br>- Tempo: 3-0-1
				<br>- Rest: 2 minutes
				<br>- The weight should be heavy enough that you are reaching mechanical failure in the rep range.

				<br>- Lie on the bench with your feet flat on the floor.
				<br>- Hold the barbell with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
				<br>- Lower the bar to your chest, then press it back up to the starting position.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="workout">
			<h2>Exercise 3: Dumbbell Pullover</h2>
			<p> Important for building overall stability

			<h2>Exercise 4: Cable Flyes</h2>

			<h2>Exercise 5: Tricep pushdowns (preferably with W bar)</h2>
			<p> This exercise will help with the lockout of the bench
				- Sets: 4
				<br>- Reps: 8
				<br>- Tempo 3-0-4
				<br>- Rest: 2-3 minutes
				<br>
				<br>- The goal of this exercise is to aid in the benchpress because the Triceps play a big role.
				<br>- Overtime with this exercise we want to build more mechanical tension.
