                - Top single and 2 sets of 5
                <br>- Run through the proper warm up for this compound movement even though you may already feel
                warm.
                <br>- Treat this bench day specifically as a strength day and to see where you're at.
                <br>- The percentage for the top single should be around 87-92% of your one rep max.
                <br>- Between each warmup make sure to take proper rest time to minimize fatigue.
                <br> After completing the top set, document it down in your notes as week 1: Benchpress total
                and be sure to include the calculated percentage.
