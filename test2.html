			<h2><a href="friday.html">Friday - Bench and Deadlifts</a></h2>
			<p>
				The bench program for this day is slightly different involving a lot of controlled
				repetitions instead of pushing as much weight as possible. In terms of deadlifts, it is 
				leaning more towards a volume and form day to minmimize injury.
				Follow the link for the assigned program for this day.
				
			    Ultimately the rest of the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) will be rest days in order to
				allow the Central Nervous System (CNS) to reset.
				This program is designed for strength and size so your CNS will need proper recovery.

				One of the main indicators that your CNS isn't receiving enough recovery is a consistent
				down trend in strength throughout this program. Obviously strength is not going to always be linear
				and increase in that way and you may run into a specific week where progress is slow or no
				progress is happening. But that shouldn't be the case for every week. This program is designed
				to help and not hurt.
